MusicRoom

Managing digital music files can be a complicated business, 
converting between audio formats, ensuring tags are 
consistent and locating extra data like cover art and lyrics.
This package provides a framework for performing these 
tasks.

The package has been designed to simplify the creation of 
a collection of scripts to carry out the essential tasks 
required to manage digital music.  A complete set of sample 
scripts has been distributed with the package.  These can 
be used directly or can be customised to meet your own 
needs.
